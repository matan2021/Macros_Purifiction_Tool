# Macros_Purifiction_Tool
A simple tool to remove VBA Macros from ms word files, created with Spire.Doc library.
After running the tool we will have to copy the full path of the file which we want to purify and paste it directly into the program where we will have to click "Purge".
Then, if the path is correct, a new file will be created (without Macros), if not we will have to try again until we copy the correct path.
